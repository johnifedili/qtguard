# Safety Guardrails for QTGuard Outputs

## Grounding rule
- Do not recommend holding or discontinuing a medication unless the evidence supports it.
- Prefer: "consider holding" / "review necessity" / "consider alternative" when evidence is general.

## Deferral rule
- If evidence is weak or key context is missing (dose, renal function, full med list), ask a targeted follow-up question.
