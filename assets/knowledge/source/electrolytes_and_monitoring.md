# Electrolytes & Monitoring (QT-risk mitigation)

## Potassium (K) target (QT-risk prevention)
- Guidelines commonly recommend keeping potassium in the higher end of normal to reduce QT-related arrhythmia risk.
- Practical target often cited in QT-risk pathways: **K = 4.0–5.0 mEq/L** (individualize to patient context and institutional policy).

## Magnesium (Mg) target (QT-risk prevention)
- Correct hypomagnesemia; many QT-risk pathways aim for **Mg >= 2.0 mg/dL** (or high-normal), depending on local practice.

## Monitoring / reassessment
- Repeat ECG after correcting electrolytes and/or changing QT-prolonging medications.
- Consider telemetry in higher-risk scenarios (e.g., QTc >= 500 ms, multiple QT-prolonging agents, symptoms, bradycardia, structural heart disease).

## Safety note
- These are decision-support targets; final decisions should follow local protocols and the treating clinician’s judgment.
